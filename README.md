## Mathematics
* first stage(April-)

In this period, I only rely on the course and exercise books of Zhangyu. Majority of my notes is on my e-textbook(which is of MarginNote3 type) and some of them are of Notability type. My textbook is Zhangyu basics 30 and my problem sets are Zhangyu basics 300 and Zhangyu 1000.
